//! Direct Memory Access (DMA) driver for i.MX RT processors.
//!
//! `imxrt-dma` provides
//!
//! - an unsafe API for defining and scheduling transfers with DMA `Channel`s.
//! - safe DMA futures for memcpy, peripheral-to-memory, and memory-to-peripheral
//!   transfers.
//!
//! This DMA driver may be re-exported from a hardware abstraction layer
//! (HAL). If it is, you should use the safer APIs provided by your HAL.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! To allocate a [`Dma`](crate::Dma) driver, you'll need to know
//!
//! 1. the location of the DMA controller registers.
//! 2. the location of the DMAMUX registers.
//! 3. the number of DMA channels supported by your chip.
//!
//! These parameters depend on the i.MX RT chip you're targeting. If you're
//! already using [`imxrt-ral`](https://docs.rs/imxrt-ral), consider using the
//! `DMA` and `DMAMUX` constants for the addresses. You're always responsible
//! for configuring the number of DMA channels.
//!
//! With those three parameters, assign a `Dma` to a static. Then, use that
//! object to create DMA [`Channel`](crate::channel::Channel)s.
//!
//! ```
//! use imxrt_dma::Dma;
//! # const DMA_PTR: *const () = core::ptr::null() as _;
//! # const DMAMUX_PTR: *const () = core::ptr::null() as  _;
//!
//! // Safety: addresses and channel count are valid for this target.
//! static DMA: Dma<32> = unsafe { Dma::new(DMA_PTR, DMAMUX_PTR) };
//!
//! // Safety: we only allocate one DMA channel 7 object.
//! let mut channel = unsafe { DMA.channel(7) };
//! ```
//!
//! Once you have a channel, you can use the higher-level DMA APIs, like
//!
//! - [`memcpy`](crate::memcpy::memcpy) for memory copies.
//! - [`write`](crate::peripheral::write) to transmit data from memory to
//!   a peripheral.
//! - [`read`](crate::peripheral::read) to receive data from a peripheral.
//! - [`full_duplex`](crate::peripheral::full_duplex) to read / write with a
//!   peripheral using a single buffer.
//!
//! Peripheral transfers depends on a peripheral's DMA support. These are signaled
//! through various [`peripheral`](crate::peripheral) traits.
//!
//! For a lower-level API, use the [`channel`](crate::channel) objects and helper
//! functions.
